hook_s
===

hook_s adds all of the hooks from the [Theme Hook Alliance](https://github.com/zamoose/themehookalliance) into the starter theme [_s](https://github.com/Automattic/_s), to make everyone happier. 


By using hook_s as your starter theme, you allow plugin developers to use a set of standardized hooks that are in standard places in your theme.

Use hook_s, hack it apart, customize it, do what ever you want.



This theme, like WordPress and _s, is licensed under the GPL.
Use it to make something cool, have fun, and share what you've learned with others.
